# Algorithms and Data Structures - Schoolwork

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures, primarily developed for educational purposes in undergraduate computer science courses. The implementations are written in Java and cover a broad range of topics in algorithms and data structures.

## Contents

The repository includes the following Java files:

1. **AVLTree.java** - Implementation of an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.
2. **BTree.java** - Implementation of a B-Tree, a general tree data structure for sorted data.
3. **BinarySearch.java** - Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
4. **CollectionDemo.java** - A demonstration of Java collection utilities.
5. **CreateRandomList.java** - Utility for creating random lists for testing.
6. **List.java** - Custom implementation of a list data structure.
7. **PerformanceTest.java** - Utility for benchmarking the performance of algorithms.
8. **SequentialSearch.java** - Implementation of sequential (linear) search.
9. **SplayTree.java** - Implementation of a Splay Tree, a self-adjusting binary search tree.
10. **TestDoubleHashingHashTableWithRehashing.java** - Test cases for a hash table using double hashing with rehashing.
11. **TestLinearProbing.java** - Test cases for a hash table using linear probing.
12. **TestQuadraticProbing.java** - Test cases for a hash table using quadratic probing.
13. **TestSeparateChaining.java** - Test cases for a hash table using separate chaining.
14. **red_black_tree.java** - Implementation of a Red-Black Tree, a balanced binary search tree.
